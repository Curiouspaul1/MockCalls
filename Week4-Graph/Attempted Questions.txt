Question -> In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
If the town judge exists, then:
The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.
Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Solution -> 
def findJudge(n, trust):
       degree = [0]*(n +1)

          for x,y in trust:
            degree[x]-=1
              degree[y]+=1
         for i in range(1, n+1):
             if degree[i] == n-1: return i
            return -1  
print(findJudge(3, [[1,3],[2,3]]))
