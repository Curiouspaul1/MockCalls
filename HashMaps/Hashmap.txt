Question:

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.


Solution: 
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        s_dict = {}

        for i in s:
            if i in s_dict:
                s_dict[i] += 1
            else:
                s_dict[i] = 1
        

        for j in t:
            if j in s_dict:
                if s_dict[j] == 1:
                     del s_dict[j]
                else:
                    s_dict[j] -= 1
            else:
                return j
