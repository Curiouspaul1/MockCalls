## How To Submit

- Clone the repo.
- Add a branch named after your whatsapp username, this is where you will push your submissions. (DO NOT SEND PULL REQUESTS).
- All weekly submissions will be added inside a folder named after the topic for the week - in this (your) branch
- Take a screenshot of your "interviewee's" attempt.
-  You may submit a link to the image or the image itself inside the folder
-  Submissions should be properly named after the question of each day. e.g Arrays/submission.png or Arrays/submission.png
(you can call the file whatever doesn't have to be 'submission.png')
